# What does "Frontend Architecture" even mean?

Here is an incomplete list of topics that may or may not constitute front-end architecture.

Is something missing? Is something poorly worded? Is something extraneous? [Please open a pull request](https://github.com/stevekinney/frontend-architecture-topics/pulls).
